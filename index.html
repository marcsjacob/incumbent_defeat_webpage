      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="section-desc">This website provides interactive access to the data underlying the paper. We identify 105 elections in which an autocratizing incumbent (or their party) sought re-election during an episode of democratic erosion. The dataset spans 63 countries from 1995 to 2024. A subsample of 51 post-2016 elections is hand-coded from Freedom House country reports to measure the scope and visibility of autocratizing acts.</p>

  <!-- Key Concepts -->
  <section class="section alt" id="concepts">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <p class="section-desc">Our analysis focuses on two dimensions of autocratization that shape whether incumbents can get away with democratic erosion at the ballot box.</p>

      <div class="concept-grid">
        <div class="concept-card">
          <h3>Visibility of Autocratization</h3>
          <p>Not all forms of autocratization are equally visible to voters. We distinguish between <strong>high-visibility</strong> repression&mdash;overt, physically coercive, or incontrovertibly undemocratic actions such as jailing opposition leaders, shutting down media outlets, or using violence against protesters&mdash;and <strong>low-visibility</strong> repression&mdash;subtle, legalistic, or technical maneuvers such as court packing, regulatory changes to media ownership, or procedural restrictions on civil society organizations.</p>
          <p class="concept-detail">The key insight is that high-visibility repression is more <em>electorally legible</em>: ordinary citizens can recognize these actions as threats to democracy without requiring elite framing or specialized knowledge. Low-visibility actions, by contrast, may erode democratic institutions just as effectively but are less likely to trigger voter backlash because they are harder to detect and interpret.</p>
          <p class="concept-link"><a href="methodology.html#visibility-index">See Visibility Index construction &rarr;</a></p>
        </div>

        <div class="concept-card">
          <h3>Scope of Autocratization</h3>

          <p>Scope measures the <strong>breadth</strong> of democratic erosion&mdash;how many distinct institutional domains are simultaneously under attack. Rather than measuring the depth of any single dimension, scope captures whether an incumbent is targeting the judiciary <em>and</em> the media <em>and</em> elections <em>and</em> civil liberties at the same time.</p>
          <p class="concept-detail">We operationalize scope by tracking six V-Dem institutional pillars (freedom of expression, freedom of association, clean elections, civil liberties, judicial constraints, and legislative constraints). When an indicator declines by at least 0.05 on V-Dem's 0&ndash;1 scale relative to its recent average, that pillar is classified as &ldquo;under attack.&rdquo; The scope count is the number of pillars simultaneously eroding. Broader scope may signal to voters that democratic backsliding is pervasive, or it may indicate that the incumbent has consolidated enough power to prevent electoral accountability.</p>
          <p class="concept-link"><a href="methodology.html#scope-index">See Scope Index construction &rarr;</a></p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="concept-callout">
        <h4>What Do We Find?</h4>
        <p>High-visibility repression is associated with a <strong>higher probability of incumbent defeat</strong> in the pooled sample. This effect is concentrated in democracies, where information environments are more open and voters can more readily translate their awareness of repression into electoral punishment. In autocracies, the relationship is weaker: even visible repression may not lead to defeat when elections themselves are compromised. Meanwhile, the erosion of <strong>horizontal constraints</strong> (checks and balances) also predicts defeat, suggesting that institutional degradation can signal regime vulnerability.</p>

  <!-- Bootstrap Coefficient Plot -->
  <section class="section" id="bootstrap">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Bivariate Bootstrap Estimates</h2>
      <p class="section-desc">Each coefficient is from a separate bivariate OLS regression of incumbent defeat (1/0) on a standardized predictor. Estimates use pre-election means (t&minus;3 to t&minus;1). Thick bars show 90% bootstrap CIs; thin bars show 95% CIs (1,000 replications). Filled points denote significance at the 90% level. Positive values indicate a greater likelihood of incumbent defeat.</p>
