  <!-- Conceptual Framework -->
  <section class="section" id="framework">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Conceptual Framework: Visibility and Scope</h2>
      <p class="section-desc">The paper introduces two key dimensions for understanding how the character of autocratization shapes electoral outcomes.</p>

      <div class="concept-grid">
        <div class="concept-card">
          <h3>Why Visibility Matters</h3>
          <p>Democratic backsliding varies enormously in how visible it is to ordinary citizens. Some autocratizing actions&mdash;like arresting opposition politicians, shutting down newspapers, or deploying riot police against peaceful protesters&mdash;are highly visible and clearly legible as anti-democratic. Other actions&mdash;like stacking constitutional courts, changing media ownership regulations, or altering administrative procedures for NGO registration&mdash;erode democratic institutions just as effectively but are far less visible to the average voter.</p>
          <p class="concept-detail">We theorize that visibility determines <strong>electoral legibility</strong>: whether voters can recognize autocratization as a threat to democracy and translate that awareness into a vote against the incumbent. In democracies, where the information environment is relatively open, highly visible repression may backfire on incumbents by making democratic erosion undeniable. In autocracies, even visible repression may not lead to incumbent defeat if the electoral playing field itself is compromised.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concept-card">
          <h3>Why Scope Matters</h3>
          <p>Scope captures how many different institutional fronts the incumbent is attacking simultaneously. An autocratizer who targets only the judiciary is narrower in scope than one who simultaneously undermines the judiciary, the media, elections, and civil liberties. Broader scope means the erosion of democracy is more pervasive and potentially more difficult to reverse.</p>
          <p class="concept-detail">Scope has an ambiguous relationship with electoral outcomes. On one hand, broader scope may signal to citizens that democracy is genuinely under threat, motivating opposition mobilization. On the other hand, broader scope may indicate that the incumbent has already accumulated enough power to manipulate elections and suppress dissent. Empirically, we find that scope is most consequential in <strong>autocracies</strong>, where it is associated with incumbent <em>survival</em>&mdash;consistent with the consolidation interpretation.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="concept-callout" style="margin-top:20px;">
        <h4>Operationalization</h4>
        <p>We measure visibility in two ways: (1) using V-Dem expert-coded indicators classified into high-visibility and low-visibility indices based on their theoretical legibility to voters, and (2) using hand-coded Freedom House country reports where each autocratizing action is coded as "visible" or "subtle." The scope index tracks the number of V-Dem institutional pillars simultaneously declining. See the detailed index construction below.</p>

      <h2>Codebook: Scope and Visibility of Autocratization</h2>
      <p class="section-desc">For the hand-coded subsample of 51 post-2016 elections, we identified autocratizing actions from Freedom House country reports published annually since 2016. Each action is classified by its institutional target and coded as either <strong>subtle</strong> (procedural, legalistic, unlikely to be recognized as anti-democratic by ordinary citizens) or <strong>visible</strong> (public, physically coercive, or incontrovertibly undemocratic). Items that are subtle when carried out at small scale may be coded as visible when carried out en masse (e.g., mass closure of NGOs, mass replacement of judges).</p>

      <h2>High-Visibility Index Construction</h2>
      <p class="section-desc">The high-visibility index measures overt, publicly visible forms of autocratization using 17 expert-coded V-Dem indicators. Each indicator is standardized <em>within country</em> to capture deviation from each country's historical baseline. The final index is the mean of these within-country standardized indicators. Higher values indicate more visible repression relative to that country's typical experience.</p>
